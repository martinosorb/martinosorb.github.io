Last year, I was introduced to the pleasure of [IPython Notebooks](http://http://jupyter.org/)  The main reason I enjoy coding on them is how easy and immediate is going from the code to the results. However, I found having to launch a terminal, cd to the directory I need, and type ‘ipython notebook’ every time quite annoying. After a bit of research, I came up with a way to directly double-click on a notebook to launch it in your default browser.
