This is the recording of a talk I gave to a popular audience as part of a series of
talks and lessons in the "Edinburgh School of AI" Meetup at Edinburgh university.

It's about the similarities and differences between the brain and deep neural networks.
It's not technical, and it's perhaps a little outdated, but I still like the general
ideas I covered.
