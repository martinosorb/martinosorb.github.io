Recently, I've been looking at [Zipf laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf_law), for our work on neural population statistics, for example a [paper by Peter Latham](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005110) on PLOS Computational Biology. At the same time, for completely different
reasons, I had a look at the [EUSA Teaching Awards](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/representation/campaigns/teachingawards/), just because, incidentally, I find them
an absolutely excellent idea. Looking at the archives of previous years' nominations, I noticed that (unsurprisingly, actually), many people get single nominations,
quite a few get two or three, and only in rare cases a large number of nominations are given together.

So, I scraped the data out of a few PDF files, and I plotted the frequency with which *k* nominations are given to a single person, for a single category, on a
single year. The result looks as follows:

The plot is log-log, so this is a power law. Note that I didn't set the x-axis to the frequency rank as in usual Zipf plots, but I chose to use the number of
nominations directly. I thought no reasonable model of this would assign higher probability to receiving *k*+1 nominations than to receiving *k*, so the non-monotonicities
we see are only due to the sample size (which is not small: 9928 total nominations in 4 years).

Finding a power law is not surprising, as these distributions appear everywhere in complex systems: probabilities of words occurring in text (the original Zipf law),
time intervals between emails consecutively sent by a user, number of neurons activated at the same time in a patch of neural tissue, avalanche sizes, and loads of other
phenomena. What is interesting is that this emerges without interaction between the students who nominate, and without interaction between the teaching staff who receive
the nominations.

For an example of explained occurrence of power-laws in human behaviour, see for example [this paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7039/full/nature03459.html)
by the complex networks pioneer A.-L. Barab√°si. Many other theories have been built around this observation; actually, rivers of ink have been spent on the subject.
